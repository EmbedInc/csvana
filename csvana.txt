csvana [options]

Display the contents of a logic analyzer CSV file.  Commands can be
entered at a command prompt to alter the drawing interactively, or to get
other information about the CSV file data.  The commands "HELP" and "?"
show the list of commands.

The command line options are:

  -IN filename
  filename

    Provides the name of the CSV file to display the contents of.  The
    second form of this command line option is only allowed when the CSV
    file name does not start with a dash (-).  The mandatory ".csv" file
    name suffix may be omitted from FILENAME.

  -DEV name

    Specifies the RENDlib device to draw onto.  The default is "right",
    which is usually a drawing window taking up the rest of the space to
    the right of a left-justified command shell.
